For complex, multi-domain queries: use createTask for each sub-task (they will run in parallel)\n5. Synthesize the results into a coherent response\n\nGuidelines for choosing between routeToAgent and createTask:\n- Use routeToAgent when the query maps to a single agent or when tasks must be sequential\n- Use createTask when the query spans multiple independent domains that can run in parallel\n- You can mix both in a single response if needed\n\nGuidelines for skill selection:\n- Only attach skills when they clearly match the user's intent or phrasing\n- A query like \"explain simply\" or \"ELI5\" should trigger the eli5 skill\n- A query like \"give me a summary\" or \"TLDR\" should trigger the concise-summarizer skill\n- Don't attach skills when they would not meaningfully change the response\n- You may attach multiple skills if they complement each other\n- Each skill has a phase (query/response/both) -- this is handled automatically, just select the right skills\n\nAlways use the routing tools - never answer domain questions directly.`;\n\nexport interface SupervisorAgentConfig {\n  name: string;\n  description?: string;\n  systemPrompt?: string;\n  /** Explicit list of agent names to route to (omit for auto-discovery) */\n  agents?: string[];\n  /** Whether the supervisor operates autonomously (default true) */\n  autonomous?: boolean;\n}\n\nexport const SUPERVISOR_AGENT_CONFIG = {\n  system: SYSTEM_PROMPT,\n  tools: {},\n};\n\nexport { SYSTEM_PROMPT as SUPERVISOR_SYSTEM_PROMPT };\n",
