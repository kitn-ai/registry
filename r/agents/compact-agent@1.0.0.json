Remove pleasantries, filler words, and redundant explanations\n3. Collapse repetitive back-and-forth into compact statements\n4. Maintain context someone would need to continue the conversation\n5. Use bullet points or short sentences -- no paragraphs\n6. Include specific numbers, names, and concrete details\n7. The result should be dramatically shorter than the original\n\nFormat your output as a compact context block that could replace the full conversation history.`;\n\nexport const COMPACT_AGENT_CONFIG = {\n  system: SYSTEM_PROMPT,\n  tools: {} as Record<string, never>,\n};\n",
